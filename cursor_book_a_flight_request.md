i would like to book a flight

**Cursor**

I'd be happy to help, but I don't have access to flight booking systems or the ability to make actual flight reservations. I can't book flights directly for you.

However, I can help you with flight-related tasks in other ways:

1. **Information gathering**: I can search the web for flight information, airline websites, or travel tips
2. **Planning assistance**: I can help you create itineraries, checklists, or travel planning documents
3. **Code/automation**: If you're building a travel-related application or want to automate some travel planning tasks, I can help with that

To book an actual flight, you would need to:
- Visit airline websites directly (like Delta, United, American Airlines, etc.)
- Use travel booking platforms (Expedia, Kayak, Priceline, etc.)
- Contact a travel agent
- Use airline mobile apps

Would you like me to help you with any of these alternative approaches, such as searching for flight information or helping you plan your trip?

Great! I can help you search for Turkish Airlines flights and create booking links using the Turkish Airlines system. To search for flights, I'll need some information from you:

**Required Information:**
1. **Origin airport** (3-letter code like IST, JFK, LHR) - Where are you departing from?
2. **Destination airport** (3-letter code) - Where are you going?
3. **Departure date** (DD-MM-YYYY format)
4. **Trip type** - One-way, round-trip, or multi-city?
5. **Number of passengers** and types (adults, children, infants)

**Optional Information:**
- If round-trip: Return date
- Preferred departure time
- Fare class preference

**Additional Services Available:**
- Check flight status
- Get booking details (if you have a PNR/booking reference)
- View baggage allowance
- Get airline promotions
- City travel guides

Could you please provide your travel details so I can search for available flights?
